#As mentioned in lesson 7A, a substring is any consecutive sequence of characters inside another string. 
#The same substring may occur several times inside the same string: for example "assesses" has the substring "sses" 2 times, and 
#"trans-Panamanian banana" has the substring "an" 6 times. Write a program that takes two lines of input, 
#we call the first needle and the second haystack. Print the number of times that needle occurs as a substring of haystack

needle=input()
haystack=input()
countNumber=0
for i in range(0, len(haystack)):
   if needle == haystack[i:len(needle)+i]:
      countNumber = countNumber+1
print(countNumber)
