#Write a program that takes a character as input (a string of length 1), which you should assume is an upper-case character; the output should be the next character in the alphabet. If the input is 'Z', your output should be 'A'. 

myWord = input ()
if myWord == "Z":
 print ("A")
if myWord != "Z":
 nextWord = ord (myWord) + 1
 print (chr (nextWord))
