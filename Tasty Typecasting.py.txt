#Write a program to help you feed your friends at a party by doing some math about square pizzas. Assume the grader defines a string inputStr for you, which is a decimal string meaning the side length L of the pizza in cm. The area of the pizza should be computed using the formula A = L*L. Then, assuming that each person needs to eat 100 cm2 of pizza, compute the number of people it can feed, rounded down to the nearest integer.
#Example: if inputStr is "17.5", the area will be 306.25 cm2, so 3 is the correct output.

inputStr1 = float (inputStr)
Area = inputStr1 * inputStr1
PerPerson = Area/100
Person = int(PerPerson)
print (Person)
