#A parcel is thrown downward at a speed of v m/s from an airplane at altitude 11000 m. 
#As it falls, its distance from the ground is given by the formula -4.9t2 - vt + 11000, 
#where t is the time in seconds since it was dropped. Write a program to output the time it will take to reach the ground. 
#The input to your program is the positive floating-point number v. The required time is given by the quadratic formula
#displaystyle{t=\frac{v-\sqrt{v^2-4(-4.9)(11000)}}{2(-4.9)}}
