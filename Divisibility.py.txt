#Write a program that reads two positive integers a and b on separate lines. If a is divisible by b, print the message "divisible". Otherwise, print the message "not divisible". For example, when the input is
#14
#3
#the program should print "not divisible".

a = int (input ())
b = int (input ())
c = a % b
if c == 0:
 print ("divisible")
if c != 0:
 print ("not divisible")
