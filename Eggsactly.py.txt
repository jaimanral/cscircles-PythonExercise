#Egg cartons each hold exactly 12 eggs. Write a program which reads an integer number of eggs from input(), then prints out two numbers: how many cartons can be filled by these eggs, and how many eggs will be left over. For example, the output corresponding to 27 eggs is
#2
#3
#since 27 eggs fill 2 cartons, leaving 3 eggs left over. 

totalEggs = int (input ())
print (totalEggs // 12)
print (totalEggs % 12)
