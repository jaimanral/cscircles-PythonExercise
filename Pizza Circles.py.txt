#Your friends have eaten their square pizzas and are now ordering a round pizza. Write a program to calculate the area of this circular pizza. The input is a float r, which represents the radius in cm. The output should be the area in cm2, calculated using the formula  A=pi*r2. 
#Use Python's pi feature instead of typing 3.1415...

import math
rValue = float (input ())
print ((math.pi) * rValue * rValue)
